# Introduction to Using Active Record

Now that we've covered object relationships and ORMs, we will introduce Active
Record, which is the part of the application responsible for representing data
and logic. ActiveRecord is an approach to access data in a database. Active
Record is an ORM, which, as we learned can make fetching and representing data
easier.

Active Record gives us a few features. In this section we will discuss:

* The Active Record conventions and why programmers use them
* Active Record query methods
* Using Active Record to create a table

In the next serval lessons, we'll learn how to build tables with Active Record,
where properties and relationships of the objects in an application are stored
and retrieved from a database without writing SQL statements.
